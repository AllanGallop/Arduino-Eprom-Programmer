# eprom tool
Tool for programming a eprom with an Arduino Mega, for retrocomputing or whatever. I use it to play games on my SNES.\
Python 3 and pyserial are needed for uploading data to the eprom
## Usage:
The script allows reading and writing to the eprom.
For programming, a vpp of 12V and a vcc of 6V must be applied to the eprom.
Eproms can only be erased with UV light.
